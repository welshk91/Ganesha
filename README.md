<h4 align="center">Android Financial Library</h4>

<p align="center">An Android library that allows developers to connect to financial accounts via Plaid's API

## Description
This library aims to ease the burden of retrieving financial data for use in apps such as stock portfolios and dividend trackers. It's built off of the [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) API. 

While possible to implement Plaid's API yourself, this library tries to handle much of the basics out-of-the-box. The goal is to provide easy access to a subset of the API to make building simple financial apps a breeze.

## How To Include
#### Warning: This library is still in 'pre-alpha'. Expect changes to the APIs!
Coming soon...


## Improvements
* Clean up skeleton app
* Add account syncing
* Add ability to get investments info
* Mock data

## Sources
* [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/docs/api/)
